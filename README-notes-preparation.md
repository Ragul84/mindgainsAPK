## 🚀 **How to Prepare Notes**

### Method 1: Using the Preparation Script

   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   export EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
   export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"

   ```

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - The script will generate notes for all topics in the list
   - Each topic takes ~2-3 seconds to generate
   - Progress is logged to console

### Method 2: Manual Database Entry

You can also manually insert notes using SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO pre_generated_notes (topic, category, difficulty, content, priority, tags) 
VALUES (
  'Your Topic Name',
  'History', -- or Polity, Economics, Geography, Current Affairs
  'intermediate', -- or beginner, advanced
  '{
    "overview": "Your overview text...",
    "timeline": [...],
    "keyPeople": [...],
    -- ... rest of the JSON structure
  }'::jsonb,
  8, -- Priority (1-10, higher = more important)
  ARRAY['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
);
```

## 📝 **Content Structure**

Each note contains:

```json
{
  "overview": "Comprehensive overview paragraph",
  "timeline": [
    {"year": "1947", "event": "Independence of India"}
  ],

ORDER BY view_count DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Notes by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM pre_generated_notes 
GROUP BY category;

-- Featured notes performance
SELECT n.topic, n.view_count 
FROM pre_generated_notes n
JOIN note_suggestions s ON n.id = s.note_id
WHERE s.is_featured = true
ORDER BY n.view_count DESC;
```
